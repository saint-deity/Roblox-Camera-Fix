This repository is an absolute (don't quote me on that 😭) fix to the behaviour of cameras allowing players to clip said cameras through walls, revealing content that should otherwise not be visible without it being released by the developer or the player finding/unlocking that content themselves. No more players shiftlocking through walls to reveal secrets you are yet to unveil! Camera glitches, gone! (kind of).

### No issues that I know of at the moment.

## Attributes
You can pause the script without disabling the script as a whole during runtime by changing the attribute `cameraeditable` (`[scriptobject]:SetAttribute (cameraeditable, [boolean]`) to false, and resume the fix by changing that same attribute back to true, though this isn't necessary as my own version uses it for something else, and thus in this version; doing so will have the same effect as disabling the script.

Additionally, changing the max camera zoom distance during runtime by changing the attribute `maxrange` (`[scriptobject]:SetAttribute (maxrange, [newrange]`) to  the new range you want to limit the player to. The max camera zoom defaults to whatever the players `CameraMaxZoomDistance` is set to (you can change this pre runtime and during runtime via `game.Players[playerobject].CameraMaxZoomDistance`.
