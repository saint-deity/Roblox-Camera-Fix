# Roblox-Custom-Shiftlock
This repository was created to upload and maintain the open-source version of my custom shiftlock for Roblox that other creators can use. The reason for creating this shift lock was to prevent users from shiftlocking to clip their cameras through walls in the game Cultivation Simulator (primarily) but also to be used for other games on Roblox.
